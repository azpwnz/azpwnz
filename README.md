I'm Andriy - a software engineer switched to web3 after 9 years working in web2.

I used to build various web projects and automations using Python. Now I'm going through rabbit hole of crypto world, building smart contracts, running test-net nodes and having fun 😃

I love software development and the spirit of entrepreneurship. 

Proud to be a member of [Developer DAO](https://www.developerdao.com/) 👨‍💻

## Web3 projects

[3lander NFT on Near blockchain](https://github.com/azpwnz/3lander-near-nft-NCD) - Smart contract that allows to mint 1 of 1 exclusive art NFT and gives the ability to the owner to determine the piece's color. There are 3 variations of the work. The owner will determine which of the 3 is displayed.

## Testnets
I'm helping various projects by running test-net nodes, validators and testing the product.
